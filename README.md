## 🎯QUEEN'S SOLVER LINKEDIN
- This is a *daily game* in linkedin I recently got playing.
- This chrome extension solves the `queen's game`.
- So what does this repo do?
  - I have created `2` **extensions**,
    - The one you can use while you are not signed in `QUEENS_EXTENSION`🏁
    - Then the next one where you have can use when u have logged in ***linkedin***,thne use `QUEENS_EXTENSION_V2`🔑
- works with any size
- Follows the below rules
## 📜Game rules
- **RULE-1:** A queen should be placed in every `row` ,`col` and `color grid` but just ***1***.
- **RULE-2:** No `2` queens can be adjacent (that is within `8` adjacent squares by contact) and they are allowed to be in same diagonal though unlike traditonal queen's algo.
